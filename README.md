# firedecor
An advanced window decoration plugin for the wayfire window manager. Still in very early alpha, so you probably shoouldn't use it!

## Configuration

- `border_size`, `font` and `button_order` work the same way as in the normal decoration plugin;
- `titlebar_height` works the same way, but it'll be deprecated;
- `font_size` sets the title font size;
- `active_border` and `inactive_border` set the colors for the border;
- `active_outline` and `inactive_outline` set the colors for the outline;
- `outline_size` sets the size for the outline;
- `corner_radius` sets the radius for the corner;

The other options have yet to be implemented.

## Goals
- [x] Implement rounded corners;
- [ ] Implement individual border sizes;
- [ ] Implement app icons;
- [ ] Implement title bars on any direction;
- [ ] Implement completely modular decoration placement;
- [ ] Implement shadows.
